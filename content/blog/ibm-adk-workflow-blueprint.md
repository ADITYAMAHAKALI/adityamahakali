## Understand the problem before touching the toolkit

IBM's Automation Development Kit (ADK) is a powerhouse for building document-intensive automations, but it expects clarity. I always document:

- The exact document types involved and their variability.
- The business rules a human follows today.
- The downstream systems that consume structured output.

This discovery phase prevents rework when the first training set hits the pipeline.

## Model the pipeline as modular services

ADK encourages separating concerns across stages such as ingestion, classification, extraction, and verification. I map each stage to a containerized microservice. That lets me iterate on extraction without redeploying ingestion, and it gives operations teams clearer ownership.

```
[Capture] -> [Normalize] -> [Classify] -> [Extract] -> [Validate] -> [Publish]
```

Each block becomes an independently testable unit with its own CI checks.

## Training accelerators worth adopting

- **Labeling studio** — invest in tight feedback loops between subject matter experts and annotators. The integrated labeling tools reduce context switching.
- **Reusable skill packs** — IBM ships pre-trained assets for invoices, claims, and KYC docs. Customize them rather than starting from scratch.
- **Confidence scoring dashboards** — business stakeholders understand sliders better than probability distributions. Translate scores into thresholds they can tweak.

## Governance is not optional

Regulated industries demand auditable trails. I route every configuration change through Git, attach change requests to Jira tickets, and export ADK run logs to a SIEM. When auditors arrive, we have a reproducible story for every model decision.

## Hand-off playbook

1. Document the end-to-end architecture with swimlanes for business and technical actors.
2. Provide runbooks for scaling clusters, retraining models, and rotating credentials.
3. Schedule quarterly capability reviews with operations teams to surface drift early.

The ADK shines when paired with disciplined engineering. Treat it as a platform, not a magic wand, and you'll ship dependable automations that make auditors and line-of-business leaders equally happy.
