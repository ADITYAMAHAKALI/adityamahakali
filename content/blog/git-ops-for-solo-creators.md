## Treat your repo like a product backlog

Even when I'm the only contributor, I keep a `CHANGELOG.md` and a running list of TODO issues. Every commit references one of those TODOs. This habit keeps context alive when I return after a few weeks and can't remember why a branch exists.

## Branch off main, merge fast

- Create a branch per feature or bug fix.
- Keep branches under ~150 lines of diff.
- Merge or delete within a week.

Small, frequent merges reduce the cognitive load of rebasing and make it safe to experiment.

## Automate boring checks

Git hooks are your best friend:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

Drop that into `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and even solo projects gain a safety net. Pair hooks with GitHub Actions or simple cron jobs to run integration tests nightly.

## Document decisions in commit messages

A good commit message answers three questions:

1. **What changed?** Summarize in 50 characters.
2. **Why?** Provide a sentence or two of context in the body.
3. **How to verify?** Mention the test or manual step.

When I follow this format, I can roll back confidently because every commit feels like a mini change request.

## Make releases feel real

- Tag stable commits with semantic versions.
- Generate release notes from the changelog.
- Publish small updates regularly to build momentum.

Consistent Git discipline is the secret to making side projects feel like shipping products, even if you're the only person pushing commits.
