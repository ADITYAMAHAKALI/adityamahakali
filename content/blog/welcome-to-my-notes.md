## Shipping thoughts faster

I have years of ideas trapped inside my personal knowledge base. Until now, turning a note into a polished blog post meant copy-pasting into a CMS, fixing formatting, and rebuilding the site.

This site now reads Markdown directly from my notes folder. When I drop a note into `content/blog`, it becomes a published article.

## Writing with Obsidian

Obsidian already stores my thinking in Markdown. Keeping everything in plain text means:

- I can version notes with Git.
- Formatting stays consistent between my editor and the website.
- Images and callouts come along for the ride.

## Publishing workflow

1. Draft and edit notes locally.
2. Commit the Markdown file alongside the code.
3. Deploy — the blog page rebuilds and exposes the new article.

> ⚡️ No CMS, no copy-paste, just Markdown.

Happy writing!
